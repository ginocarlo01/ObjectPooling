# ObjectPooling
 
Object Pooling is basically the process of instantiating several objects at the beginning of a scene and placing them in a "pool," where they remain inactive. When we need to use one of these objects, instead of instantiating it, we simply take it from the pool and activate it. The action of retrieving the object from the pool is done through queues, which easily organize the objects using the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.
